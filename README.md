## Overview
  I want a user to be able to search by location and get a response back with weather, yelp(food), meetups(events), movies, and hiking trails for and around that location. I want my data to persist through SQL so that there is a faster response time for the user.

## Getting Started
  For a user to build this app they would need to: 
    - Set up their dev enviroment.
    - Utilize API's, SQL, JavaScript, and the prebuilt front end.
    - They would need to host their app as well, possibly using a deployment site like Heroku.

## Architecture
  The application takes a pre built front end and uses a user built backend to deliver and save data. This is done with JavaScript, SQL, PSQL, as well as th following libraries: express, pg, superagent, cors, and dotenv.

## Change Log

02-25-2019 1300 - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for all resources. -->
